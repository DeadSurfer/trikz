	The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

	The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
	to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
	the GNU General Public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
	share and change all versions of a progrm--to make sure it remins free
	software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
	GNU General Public license for most of our software; it applies also to
	any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
	your programs, too.*/
